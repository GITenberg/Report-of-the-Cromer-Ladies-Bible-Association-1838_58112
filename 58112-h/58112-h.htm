11</span>REPORT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span>, the committee of the
Ladies&rsquo; Bible Association for Cromer and its neighbourhood,
consider it our duty to lay before our subscribers, the prefixed
statement of the condition of our charge; and in doing so, we
think it may be expedient to accompany the same with some
extracts from the slight records which we have kept of our
proceedings, since Nov. 1827, when our friend, Mr. J. J. Gurney,
now on a christian mission in America, first called us
together.</p>
<p>We may premise that in our note of the first year, (1828,) we
find the need of the society indicated by the fact, that in one
outlying district, a poor woman had lately given three shillings
for the tattered remains of a bible.&nbsp; The announcement of
the formation of our association, and of the facility which it
afforded for obtaining bibles, was received with pleasure
throughout the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Many parents were desirous to
avail themselves of the opportunity of providing bibles for their
children, and even some solitary old couples who could not read
themselves subscribed, that they might have a bible in the house
for their neighbours to read to them.</p>
<p>The young people were generally found eager to
subscribe.&nbsp; All the girls (but one) of one school gave their
names as soon as the plan was proposed to them, and several
having supplied themselves with bibles, continue as free
subscribers, and take much <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>interest in reading the monthly
extracts.&nbsp; It was pleasant too, to see the desire of
children in various places, to devise a way to earn their own
subscriptions.&nbsp; One little girl, who had a hen, set aside
the first chickens for the payment of hers, and an errand boy
volunteered to run some additional miles, to obtain a few pence
for his.</p>
<p>Some interesting particulars of the effect of passages of the
word of God upon individuals, have occasionally been related in
conversation with the collectors.&nbsp; On one of these applying
to a young man, the latter said, that though he had a bible, he
would willingly subscribe five shillings for another, (as a gift
we suppose, to some friend,) and he proceeded to say, that when
very young he was very thoughtless, and, for a length of time,
had feared neither God nor man.&nbsp; Being alone one day in his
father&rsquo;s house, he saw a bible lying on a window seat; he
opened it in a careless manner, and his eye was caught by a verse
of awful denunciation against sinners.&nbsp; He could not bear
it, and flung the bible into a corner of the room, and went
out.&nbsp; The words still haunted him, and, on his return after
some time, seeing the bible still on the floor, he picked it up,
and opening it again, observed a passage containing, as he said,
&ldquo;a promise, a blessed invitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
attention was happily attracted, he read on, and from that time,
formed a habit of reading the scriptures, which has proved, as he
thankfully acknowledged, a blessing to his soul.</p>
<p>We may now mention an instance of the utility of reading the
bible freely and undauntedly to others.&nbsp; A gentleman, who
had been in the practice of reading in the cottages, went into
one for this purpose on the evening of a fair held in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; He found the old woman on whom he had called
gone to bed, but five or six rough-looking men were sitting round
the fire, and hesitatingly he asked, if they <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>would let him
read a chapter to them.&nbsp; They, with at least equal
hesitation, assented, and our friend asked for a bible.&nbsp;
They brought him first a Latin testament, but at last a large
bible was brought from another cottage, and he read to them the
26th chapter of St. Matthew&rsquo;s gospel, and spoke to them on
the injunctions there given.&nbsp; They all became
attentive.&nbsp; One of the men who had been a smuggler, and much
addicted to drinking, and who would probably have finished his
evening by intoxication at the fair, appeared particularly struck
by what he then heard.&nbsp; On his going home, his wife was
astonished at his altered demeanor, but dared not speak to him;
his daughter, however, asked him, &ldquo;what he had been
doing?&rdquo;&nbsp; On which, he answered her in his uncouth way,
that he had &ldquo;been praying and would pray again, for so the
gentleman had told him from the book.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man
entirely changed his habits from this time.&nbsp; The following
harvest he was seen by the same gentleman, coming out of a farm
house with a party of fellow-labourers, and his kind friend spoke
to him, fearing he had as formerly indulged himself.&nbsp; The
poor man replied, &ldquo;I have been doing, sir, what I never in
my life did before, I have refused a pint of beer, for I did not
want it;&rdquo; and his companions confirmed his words.&nbsp; His
resolution was put to a severer test the next summer, for being
lame he was set to keep the birds from a field directly opposite
one of the new public-houses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it not a
temptation to you?&rdquo; said the same gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
sad temptation, sir, and very hard it is; but I have resisted and
kept out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor man&rsquo;s conduct to his family
was equally improved; and we have perhaps the more pleasure in
giving this little history, as it happened that the bible, which
was rendered the instrument of convincing this poor man of the
error of his ways, was furnished by our association.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>We must
here acknowledge that it in the spirit with which subscriptions
are offered, and the prayers with which they are accompanied,
which give value to the little collections, and we trust that the
prevailing motive in most of the givers, is the honest desire to
spread the knowledge of that gospel which they have themselves
learnt to prize.&nbsp; It is however pleasant, when such a desire
is expressed.&nbsp; Thus on one of our districts being lately
revisited with a view more especially to the promotion of free
subscriptions, a fisherman came forward with his twopence a
month, saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;May a blessing go with it; and
perhaps even that, may be the means of saving one
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; A poor woman too, on giving her offering, said
to the collectors, &ldquo;If I have to work ever so hard, I will
have the penny ready when you come again; for I will pay it for
the sake of the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more instance of the same kind, we cannot refrain from
giving as related by a beloved and lamented young member of our
committee, who laboured diligently during her brief career, to
lead others to the knowledge of those promises of the Redeemer,
of which we may thankfully believe she has experienced the
blessed fulfilment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;December 13th, 1833.&nbsp; We called on a
poor woman to-day, who wished to subscribe for a bible for her
son.&nbsp; After she had told us the size, she said, &lsquo;I am
afraid of being troublesome, but might I give a trifle to the
Bible Society?&rsquo;&nbsp; God, she said, had done so much for
her, and she felt such a great desire to do something for his
glory; then she thought what a poor, miserable, sinful creature
she was, could she be permitted to do anything in his
service?&nbsp; What to do she could not guess!&nbsp; Then she
thought she would set to work, and what she could spare of her
earnings, she would give with all her heart to the Bible Society,
if I would be so kind as <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>to receive it.&nbsp; She made many
more acknowledgments of God&rsquo;s mercy, particularly that of
opening her mind, to understand the word of God, which though she
had read, it was without profit to herself, till lately, and when
people used to speak to her of the benefit of reading it, she
hardly believed them, but now she found it was her greatest
comfort; when she opened her bible, she seemed directed to the
particular passage that suited her case; and when she went to a
place of worship, whatever the minister said, seemed meant for
her.&nbsp; She could not express all she felt for these mercies,
but still to be silent, she knew would be wrong.&nbsp; It was
settled that she should pay one penny a week, and when she gave
me her first penny, she said, &lsquo;May God&rsquo;s blessing go
with my mite, that it may be useful.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;A.
U.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of our committee gives the following account of a poor old
deaf widow, well known for twenty years past, as a consistent
earnest christian:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She is thankful to have been enabled to
read and understand her bible.&mdash;It was for some time a
sealed book to her; she read it as a duty, but did not feel its
power; she was convinced something was wrong in herself, and one
evening, after having suffered much unhappiness at not being able
to enjoy her bible as some did, she locked her cottage door,
closed her shutter, spread her bible on her little table, and
with tears, in earnest prayer, begged that God would show her her
error, and the way of true happiness.&nbsp; She chanced to have
opened her bible at the 16th of St. John, and her eye caught the
verse, &lsquo;Hitherto hast thou asked nothing in my name, ask
and thou shalt receive, that thy joy may be full.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This verse powerfully impressed her mind with the mistake she had
been guilty of.&nbsp; She pleaded ever after the intercession of
her Mediator, and has <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>constantly enjoyed that peace and
comfort his blessed word so fully promises.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same lady writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The simplicity of a little child may not be
uninteresting to those who wish to trace the use of the bible, in
its effects upon the poor.&mdash;A boy of eight years old, seeing
his old grand-mother overwhelmed with grief at a severe loss of
property, which she was quite unequal to retrieve, went up and
kissing her, said, &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t grieve, God will be
sure to take care of you.&mdash;The bible tells us, he is a
friend to the widow, and that must be true.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poor
woman was so struck by the earnestness of the child, that she
made up her mind not to grieve, but to trust in God, and she is
now happy and cheerful again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She adds of another person who had lingered many years in
acute suffering, and whose departure was at length drawing
near:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. W. continues to evince most
strikingly the power of the bible to give comfort and support in
the greatest need.&nbsp; She said to me,&mdash;&lsquo;What would
have become of me, had I been born in a heathen land, without a
bible to rest upon?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A gentleman, who was looking after some crews that had been
wrecked in the storm of Sept. 1st, 1833, went into a room at the
public house where they were staying, and found one young man
alone, with a book before him.&nbsp; He observed it was a bible,
issued by our British and Foreign Society, and asked him if he
was reading it.&nbsp; The young man said, &ldquo;Yes, he did not
know that he could read a better book, for it was worth the
saving.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then said, he had bought it
&ldquo;because it was so cheap, only three shillings, and a very
fine book!&rdquo;&nbsp; Our friend remarked to him, that he
&ldquo;must know such bibles could not be built for that price,
but that it was <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>afforded by means of a subscription.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
he said he knew, and then observed, that sailors were now reading
their bibles at his port, Shields, more than they used to
do.&nbsp; The gentleman said, he hoped that they were not
hypocrites.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the sailor said, &ldquo;he
thought not; he believed the prayer meetings and bible readings
at the time of the cholera, had had a real effect upon numbers of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We would earnestly recommend our associates not to lose the
opportunities, which their proximity to a dangerous coast too
frequently affords, of applying the word of God to the comfort of
the ship-wrecked mariner, and of fixing religious impressions
which may have arisen in hours of peril.&nbsp; We possess a small
dep&ocirc;t of Dutch and French testaments, for the use of
foreigners under such circumstances, and have occasionally found
them acceptable.&nbsp; Our local position also calls for our
unremitting efforts to enlighten our fishermen, whose lives are
so often in jeopardy.&nbsp; The precariousness of their situation
is an argument to which persons of this class will be found
peculiarly accessible, when pressed to acquaint themselves
betimes with the way of salvation.&nbsp; Fishermen, too, have
many spare hours, while waiting for the tide, or detained by bad
weather, on shore or in harbour: we remember the pleasure with
which a fisherman, who had lately learnt to read, spoke to us of
the delight he enjoyed in spelling out a chapter of the
testament, in the cuddy of his herring boat, during many dreary
winter evenings that he was moored in Boston Bay.</p>
<p>For the sake of suggesting profitable topics of discourse, and
of obtaining from time to time correct information respecting the
progress of our work, and the moral condition of our districts, a
set of queries for our collectors was drawn up soon after the
beginning of our association, and it is from the answers <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>to these,
that most of our facts are gathered.&nbsp; Some advantage is
gained by keeping notes of our visits, the state of a family is
the better remembered, and appropriate remarks may be made.&nbsp;
Thus in one house, which was without a bible, the woman on being
asked if she would subscribe, answered, she would consider about
it.&nbsp; The visitor turned to her book and said, &ldquo;Mrs. L.
you gave me that very answer when I called before, and that is
four years ago to-morrow; time flies.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was so
struck that she immediately paid a penny towards a half-crown
testament, evidently frightened at her own procrastination.</p>
<p>Many of our stories bear on the desirableness of a diligent
and frequent revision of our work.&nbsp; We give an extract from
the notes of one of our committee, in 1833:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having been somewhat struck with the
example of the ladies of Wisbeach, recorded in the extracts for
last October, of recanvassing their districts once in three
years, I thought it might be well to visit a neighbouring village
for this purpose.&nbsp; I did this, with the cordial concurrence
of the collector, who though diligent and persevering is
incapacitated by circumstances and health from extra
exertions.&nbsp; We visited every house in the place, with
scarcely an exception, and found 23 persons willing to pay for
bibles and testaments.&nbsp; The place has had a constant, though
small supply, but there would be a much larger demand, were it
not for the lamentable want of education.&nbsp; Perhaps the
discovery of such a state of things may prove in some instances
one of the indirect benefits of bible visiting.&nbsp; The effects
of the bibles and testaments already distributed, were in some
instances happily observable.&nbsp; Many were shown me which had
been purchased from the society, and some appeared to have been
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>used and
valued as we should wish.&nbsp; One elderly and very poor woman
showed me her bible, and said, &lsquo;eighteen years ago I learnt
to read in it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked how she had learnt at so
advanced an age, being now nearly sixty: she replied, &lsquo;I
went down on my knees and asked God Almighty to teach me, and he
did.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said I did not doubt that this was the best
way, but I asked her what means had been used?&nbsp; She told me
that she had heard a sermon preached on a text in St. John, which
so strongly impressed her mind, that she felt an earnest desire
to read it again.&nbsp; Having found the place, she spent nearly
the whole night trying to spell the words, and returned to the
employment the next day, till her son came in, and on his
expressing surprise at her attempting to read, she said,
&lsquo;Then why should not <i>you</i> teach me? so he taught me
whenever he came in from work, and now I can read a chapter any
where in the bible.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this case, if the Bible
Society did not excite the desire, it was ready to furnish the
means of gratifying it, to the great and lasting blessing
apparently of the individual in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another very old woman spoke in such terms of her
testament, as to make me feel most thankful she had ever had
it.&nbsp; She reads it constantly, to her old infirm husband, and
says, &lsquo;I know it is all I have to attend to, for I am
getting very forward in age.&rsquo;&nbsp; I expressed a hope that
she knew to whom to look for safety in the hour of death; she
burst into tears at the name of the Saviour, and earnestly
expressed her sole dependence upon him, saying, she found herself
full of sins and infirmities, but that his redemption was
sufficient.&nbsp; She showed me a friend&rsquo;s tract sent her
several years ago by a lady, and said it had done her as much
good as any thing (saving her bible) that she had in the house;
also a little hand-bill, dropped in the road by some ladies, <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>it was
entitled, &lsquo;Do you ever pray?&rsquo; and she said she had
read it over and over, and it always reminded her of her
duty.&nbsp; I cannot precisely repeat her conversation, but it
made me strongly feel the truth of that text: &lsquo;Cast thy
bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many
days.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the road I met a very infirm and afflicted
old woman, the survivor of a husband and, I think, of six
children, living on two shillings per week.&nbsp; I asked her
whether she had a bible.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, I paid in for one
several years ago, and it is the greatest comfort I have
had.&rsquo;&nbsp; I afterwards saw her in her own abode, a
wretched hovel, with a chimney in the middle, where she lives
with her old and most wretched mother-in-law.&nbsp; She showed
me, with pride, her precious bible, for which she had paid
7<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, and said, &lsquo;I spared the money when
I wanted it for bread many a time, but I have never grudged it,
it is all the comfort I have, and much more comfort than victuals
to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believe, also, the effects of it may be
seen in her forbearance and attention to her afflicted
companion.&nbsp; Having completed my round, I took my list to the
collector, who gladly received it, and will enter with fresh
spirit on her increased task.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The benefit of carefully revisiting our districts, has been
lately again exemplified; when on our collectors going to nearly
all the families of a small circuit, about one hundred, most of
which had already provided themselves with bibles from our
institution, they obtained sixty-four new free subscribers, (many
indeed of but one half-penny per month,) and twenty-three for
bibles and testaments.&nbsp; This was after the interest of the
people had been excited by an address from the zealous agent of
the Norwich Auxiliary Society, delivered at Overstrand, in the
church of the long tried friend and unwavering advocate of <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>our cause,
the Rev. John Cubitt.&nbsp; One poor woman said, that after
hearing the gentleman, she went home, and poured out her soul to
God for the heathen, and on offering her half-penny, she said,
&ldquo;she gave it to the Lord, and wished she could make it
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her husband, and a daughter, have also
subscribed a penny per month, free.</p>
<p>When a district becomes fairly stocked with bibles, we cannot
expect to find so many anecdotes, furnished by the contrast
between the condition of destitute villages, and that of those
supplied with the holy scriptures, but we think we may say that
within the last ten years, owing, as we believe, to this society,
combined with the extension of education, and other causes, there
is, amongst the people of this neighbourhood, a perceptible
advance in their acquaintance with the word of God.&nbsp; This
is, we think, apparent, if only in the increased readiness with
which the people turn to the chapters and verses referred to by
ministers in their sermons, or on other occasions, when the
scriptures are read and explained to them.&nbsp; We hope, and we
cannot but believe, that acquaintance with the letter of
scripture must produce its corresponding fruits.&nbsp; Of these,
however, it is not our province to speak rashly, but we may
observe that the contrast is very striking between the moral
state, and intellectual powers of the labouring classes of those
countries where the scriptures are in general use, and those
where they have no access to the written rule of life.&nbsp; The
operations of the Bible Society, and the need that exists for its
redoubled exertions are fully set forth in the annual reports,
and in the monthly extracts.&nbsp; You may not, however, be
displeased to have a few facts bearing on these points, which
came under the notice of two of your own associates, during
excursions on the continent, in the summers of 1836 and <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>1838.&nbsp;
In the little intercourse that they managed to get with the
people, they had reason to feel the contrast above alluded to;
they felt the want of an acknowledged rule of common reference in
conversing with individuals of those countries from which the
bible is very much excluded.&nbsp; If, for instance, they gave a
tract on the keeping of the sabbath, they found the people had no
sense of the sabbath, as a day of religious observance, because
they had no understanding of its being enforced as such in the
scriptures.&nbsp; There was no bringing them &ldquo;to the law
and to the testimony,&rdquo; which they possessed not.&nbsp; Very
different is the effect of conversing with the well-taught
peasantry of Scotland.&nbsp; You are aware that the scriptures
are circulated with difficulty in the Austrian dominions.&nbsp;
In Prague, once the seat of biblical study, and whence issued one
of the very earliest printed translations of the bible, a
bookseller told your associates that the Bohemian bible was a
prohibited book; he might obtain a copy for a known customer, but
it would be a smuggling transaction.&nbsp; Your associates were
much struck by the wretched appearance of the Jews in that
city.&nbsp; They have a separate quarter there, as well as at
Frankfort, and in both it was melancholy to drive through the
narrow, crowded streets, and to observe the squalid degraded
countenances, and the repugnance with which they seemed to regard
the christian strangers.&nbsp; It made them long to extend to
them the boon which they could receive with equal pleasure and
profit&mdash;their own scriptures, in their own revered
language.&nbsp; Your associates did not scruple to offer a few
tracts in their passage through Austria and Bohemia, and they
noticed that those which consisted solely of scriptural extracts
were received with the most pleasure: they often left groups
reading them aloud, around the post houses.&nbsp; The same may be
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>said of
the French text books, selected by Mrs. Fry, which were always
received as a most acceptable present, and so were the few copies
of the New Testament, which they were able to carry.</p>
<p>A friend of theirs, Mrs. R. Fox, of Falmouth, had been in the
South of France, last Spring, and had mentioned to your
associates, that she had been much pleased with a young pair,
Roman Catholics, who kept the small hotel attached to the
post-house at Orange.&nbsp; She found they were just married, and
she left them a bible as a wedding present.&nbsp; Your associates
asked the pleasing young landlady, if she had made any use of the
bible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;her husband and
herself read a chapter of it <i>every</i> evening;&rdquo; and the
warmth with which they received the friends of the donor, proved
their true value for the gift.</p>
<p>In France, though there may be some opposition to the
dispersion of the scriptures, especially in the south, no danger
can be incurred by the attempt.&nbsp; In the Sardinian dominions,
the case is far different, and it ought to teach us to value our
own privileges, when we reflect on the sufferings still endured
by others, in their adherence to the testimony of Jesus.&nbsp;
When your associates were at Nice last July, they heard of a very
respectable man, a small farmer, who had just been released from
the dungeons of the neighbouring Villa Franca, where he had been
spending six months in a vault sunk in the rocky cliff below the
level of the sea, for the crime of reading the bible to his wife,
under his own tree on a Sunday.&nbsp; The gentleman who told them
this fact, assured them also, that though P&ndash;&rsquo;s
affairs had suffered from his imprisonment, he was not a man to
be daunted, nor was he likely to waver in his faith, or in his
practice of studying the scriptures.&nbsp; Two other <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>householders
had also been imprisoned that spring for the same cause.</p>
<p>Your associates could venture to give but few tracts and one
or two testaments in their passage through Piedmont and
Savoy.&nbsp; These however were received with much
interest.&nbsp; The contrast was striking when they reached
Geneva, and found a bible in every set of rooms of their well
appointed hotel.&nbsp; They believe this is usual in the
Protestant cantons, at least they found the same at other hotels,
and Mr. Scholl the pasteur of Lausanne told them, they had been
placed there by the committee of the Bible Society.&nbsp; A great
work of religion is carried on by means of this society, and also
of the Protestant Evangelical Societies of France and
Swisserland, which combine the objects of bible, missionary, and
tract societies.&nbsp; For the former, they chiefly employ the
colporteurs or travelling salesmen, described by M. de
Pressens&eacute; in his excellent account of the operations of
the Bible Society in France, (printed in the appendix to the last
report 1838,) and all that is there said of the usefulness of
this devoted class of men, was amply confirmed by the information
your associates gained respecting their labours.&nbsp; These too
they perform for so small a remuneration, that it is clear they
are only prompted by conscientious motives. 100,000 copies of the
scriptures are now yearly distributed in France, and the
directors of the societies find, that it answers much better to
sell them at a low price, than to give them away.&nbsp; The
people are less willing to surrender their bibles to be burnt by
the priests, if they have paid a sum of money, however small, for
their purchase.&nbsp; In some few instances, the Roman Catholic
priests themselves have been willing to promote the sale of the
scriptures.&nbsp; Amongst the countries which your associates
most desired to see provided with the scriptures, should any
opportunity offer of aiding the <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>supply, were the valleys of the Alps,
the people of which are confined by the snows for months
together, and express great desire for a store of winter&rsquo;s
reading.&nbsp; They met with a gentleman who had lately visited
Felix Neff&rsquo;s parishes of the Hautes Alpes.&nbsp; They asked
if his work stood; he assured them it did, and said that
Neff&rsquo;s people showed the effect of his labours by the
morality of their conduct, and especially by their kindness
towards each other, and freedom from petty quarrels, and disputes
about their strips of fertile land, which, from the general
barrenness of the soil, form a frequent source of litigation
amongst little proprietors in such situations.&nbsp; They are
however, excessively poor; the best Sunday dinner they had to
offer our friend was soup made with suet, like tallow, and dried
beans, with black bread two years old chopped with a hatchet; the
fare which killed poor Neff: he much wished that a supply of
bibles could be sent them, for they greatly needed them.&nbsp;
They had kept up the schools established by Neff, and in the long
winter&rsquo;s evenings used to meet in the cow-houses (for
warmth) to read by lamp light, but they were very destitute of
books of all kinds.&nbsp; In no way, perhaps, could a grant of
bibles be better bestowed, than amongst these well-disposed
mountaineers, who may be in danger of losing the christian
standing they have acquired under the influence of a most devoted
minister, if they are not assisted to keep up their knowledge of
the word of God which he so successfully laboured to infuse.</p>
<p>We cannot omit to notice, that our association had pleasure in
taking its little share in the grant issued by the Parent
Society, in thankful commemoration of the event of the first of
August, 1834, the abolition of slavery throughout the British
dominions.&nbsp; Some of our subscribers especially, took this
occasion of proving that a liberal spirit is not to be
circumscribed <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>by restricted means.&nbsp; The behaviour of the negroes
on the day of their first emancipation, and on that of its
completion by the termination of the apprenticeship, Aug. 1st,
1838, has been such as to afford an assurance that they could
appreciate the gift.&nbsp; A private letter from Trinidad says,
that the first of August last, &ldquo;was spent in praise,
reading the scripture and prayer; all was order and peace.&nbsp;
Not a drum or dance was heard, and the best of feeling pervaded
every heart;&rdquo; and another from Jamaica, that &ldquo;the day
was there held as a sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In retracing our course, many pleasing recollections present
themselves; we could name an aged friend of the cause, who had
always given us her cordial support, the last act of whose
existence as to worldly affairs was to put into her
daughter&rsquo;s hand her subscription for the bible and other
societies, in advance for the ensuing year, (1832,) with a warm
expression of the love for that gospel which must, she was
convinced, finally spread and prevail.&nbsp; We could speak of
another, a member of our committee, who has carried the good
wishes of us all to a distant island, (Ceylon,) where she is
placed, and we doubt not to useful purpose, amongst scenes of
heathen darkness, which she could effectively feel for, when she
little expected to behold them.&nbsp; Others of our
fellow-labourers have been called to other spheres of active
duty; but in one sense we may truly say, that our band has never
been disunited.&nbsp; It will be seen from the prefixed statement
of our secretaries that we have distributed 2450 bibles and
testaments, since our commencement, but we fear that the obvious
remark (on the inspection of our accounts) will be this, that our
efforts have not advanced in the ratio that might have been
expected; we are, however, convinced, that there needs but a
vigorous push to carry the present year&rsquo;s gathering ahead
of any former sum, and this gratification <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>we would call
upon our friends, to secure for themselves and for us.&nbsp; We
trust indeed that the work of renovation has been already put in
train by the labours of Mr. Wiseman, (the society&rsquo;s agent,
to whom we have already alluded,) in forming new village
associations, and in exciting a fresh spirit of zeal amount
us.&nbsp; Our hearty desire is, that every family in all our
districts may be brought into direct connexion with a society,
which has already circulated nearly eleven million copies of the
holy scriptures.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
